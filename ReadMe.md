## DESCRIPTION ##
youtube.exe download mp3„ÄÅHQ mp4 from youtube.com, you put in a list, it search and download for you.

## STORY ##
I love music, when I hear a greate song, I search it in Youtube and try to store it as a treasure. Although there are many Chrome plug-ins or website claims that they help for it, but none of them is really handy. Some show annoying poping ads, and other need you to copy youtube link one by one. So I wondered, how about just put in a songs list, then work done! That's why this project borned.

## EASY TO USE ##
- Input songs/singer for each line in `list.txt`, you can use space to seperate the keywords just like you do in Youtube search bar.
- If you know what exact you want, you still can put Youtube link.
- If the line start with ! mark and give URL, it will be download as video(MP4).
- Double click `youtube.exe`, give yourself a coffee, and songs will be prepared in `Songs` folder. 


## CONFIGURATION ##
- You input will download 2 sources, ordered by search results(in case that the keyword may not be specific enough). Change this setting by edit `config.ini`.
- `list.txt` must be UTF-8 format.

## REFERENCE ##
This project mainly depends on https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/ , thanks!
