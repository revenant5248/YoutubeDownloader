## DESCRIPTION ##
youtube.exe download mp3、HQ mp4 from youtube.com. Feed it a list, it search and download for you.

## STORY ##
I love music, when I hear a greate song, I search it on Youtube and try to store it as a treasure. Although there are many Chrome plug-ins or websites claims that they help for it, but none of them is really handy. Some show annoying pop-up ads, and the other need you to copy youtube link manually. So I wondered, how about just put in a songs list, get the work done! That's why this project borned.

## EASY TO USE ##
- Input songs/singer into each line in `list.txt`, you can use space to seperate keywords just like you do in Youtube search bar.
- If you know what exact you want, you can still input Youtube link/Url.
- If the line start with ! mark and followed by URL, it will be download as HQ video(MP4).
- Double click `youtube.exe`, sit back and have a cup of coffee, songs will be prepared in `Songs` folder. 


## CONFIGURATION ##
- Your input will download from 2 different sources by default, ordered by search results(in case that the keyword may not be specific enough). Change this setting by edit `config.ini`.
- `list.txt` must be in UTF-8 format.

## REFERENCE ##
This project mainly depends on https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/ , thanks!
